Program Name: Roman Numeral Calculator v1.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This program is an implementation of basic Roman Numerals operations.
Development was crafted using Test Driven Development paradigm.
Following are some instructions useful to examine functionalities of the program,


1. Unit test cases are written using check unit test framework ("tests" directory)
2. Makefile in tests directory will produce an executable (test_exe) to examine test results
3. There is also a driver program (driver.c) in top directory
4. Running Makefile in top directory will create an executable (driver_exe) for driver program in "bin" directory
5. Running driver_exe would let user to play with the calculator
6. In case of subtraction operation it is assumed that user first enter first operand and then second operand
7. Valid roman numerals range is assumed as (1 to 3999) inclusive
8. It is assumed that user will input roman numerals in valid range
9. In case an operation produce a roman numeral outside valid range, driver program will inform user and keep continuing
